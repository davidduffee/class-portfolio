      <p>“The best part about a road trip is finding those great hole-in-the-wall spots. Finding local coffee shops and diners is a must-do for me when I’m on the road.”<p>

    <p>The Outcome: <br> 62 out of 72 people surveyed said that finding cool local spots and unique places was one of their favorite things to do on roadtrips.
      That comes second only to sightseeing.</p>

  <div class="the-problem">
    <h5>The Problem</h5>

    <img src="code/arizona-van.png">

<p> Real roadtrippers love to take the path less
  traveled by!
  <br> <br>
  These travelers value the
  memories of their trips with their friends
  and believe that the best memories occur
  in unique places. 
  <br> <br>
  However, they often
  discover that these paths are hard to find.

    <p>We believe connecting the right travelers with the right locals, for young adults on road trips, will give travelers new, unique experiences in unfamiliar places along their journey to their final destination.</p>
